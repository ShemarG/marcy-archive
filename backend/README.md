backend setup

install MongoDB community edition
install mongoshell
optionally, install Mongo Compass
create a data folder for Mongo db
to start db, navigate to the install path of mongoDB and run mongod.exe, and specify the db path to the data folder. For example:
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\6.0\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="d:MongoDB\data"

Or you could skip all this and just go to the docs and read that
