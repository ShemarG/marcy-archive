### How to run
The frontend and backend are seperate entities, therefore it is best to set them up separately, and run them as such.
Start with the backend, get the MongoDB setup ready, then get it connected to the backend. After this the frontend should be relatively easy to get setup in a separate terminal.

#### Note: 
Specific instructions for each setup located in their respective directory README files
